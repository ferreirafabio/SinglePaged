I'm a Computer Science / Machine Learning M. Sc. student at KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany. Currently, I’m engaged with a 1-year research project at the IAR (Institute for Anthropometry and Robotics), investigating the value of latent representations created by deep video prediction models working towards the long-term goal of bringing forth intelligence in robotics.

In March 2016, when I began my bachelor thesis on Deep Learning with CNNs at Bosch Corporate Research, my interest in Deep Learning was kindled, which set off my desire for entirely laying my future focus on Machine Learning. Prior to that, I had not gained any experience in Machine Learning except a Computer Vision course during the Bachelor’s but nevertheless was able to submit very good work during the thesis. I gained my B. Sc. with distinction in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences in Karlsruhe.
