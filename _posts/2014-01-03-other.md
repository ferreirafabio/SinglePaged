* __Research project "DeepEpisodicMemory" finished__ <br/>
Results and code made available [here](http://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/projects/episodicmemory). Paper still pending for review at ICRA 2018.

* __Made available an implementation that emerged from the DeepEpisodicMemory research project__ <br/>
Code available [here](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/video2tfrecords). The implementation allows to easily convert RGB video data (e.g. .avi) to the TensorFlow tfrecords file format with the provided 3 color channels for training e.g. a NN in TensorFlow. Due to common hardware/GPU RAM limitations in Deep Learning, this implementation allows to limit the number of frames per video that are actually stored in the tfrecords. 

* __Python implementation that computes the minimum edit distance for two strings (according to the Wagner-Fischer algorithm)__ <br/>
Implemented in the context of a cognitive systems class course work. [Code](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/minimum-edit-distance-py)

* __Python algorithm for deciphering a Vigen√®re-encoded message__ <br/>
Implemented in the context of a cryptography class course work. [Code](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/vigenere-py) 

* __Machine Learning Course Summaries__ <br/>
Started collecting and scanning summaries about the lecture "Machine Learning 1" at KIT (in German, Syntax: [Chapter Topic])
