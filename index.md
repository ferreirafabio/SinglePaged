## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.gif">
I'm a computer science / machine learning M. Sc. student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) with interest in machine learning for robotics, which I currently pursue at the H2T lab ([High Performance Humanoid Technologies](http://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php)) as a research assistant. I gained my Computer Science B. Sc. with distinction from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences in September 2016 and am a scholar of the German National Academic Foundation.


## Research

+ __since 12/2017__ <br/>
Research project in the financial sector in which the feasibility of NNs for estimating (conditional) probability densities in a non-parametric way is investigated. 

+ __Paper implementation "Movement Primitives via Optimization" (Dragan et al., 2015)__ <br/>
During a research project, a fellow student and I implemented the mathematical concepts of the paper "Movement Primitives via Optimization" (Dragan et al., 2015) and made the code available. [[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/movement_primitives_via_optimization)

+ __11/2016-11/2017__ <br/>
title: "Deep Episodic Memory: Encoding, Recalling, and Predicting Episodic Experiences for Robot Action Execution" <br/>
1-year research project at the H2T, investigating the value of latent representations generated by video prediction models, working towards the long-term goal of bringing forth intelligence in robotics. Paper under review at Robotics and Automation Letters [[website]](http://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/projects/episodicmemory)[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04134)

+ __03/2016-07/2016__ <br/>
Bachelor thesis "Optimal Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Defect Classification in Images", at the Robert Bosch Corporate Research department

## Coding

+ __video feature extraction and fisher vectors__ <br/>
Released a python package for video/image feature extraction (ResNet, VGG, SIFT, SURF) that based on the selected feature type, trains a fisher vector GMM and computes the (improved) fisher vectors. [[code]](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/videofeatures) or "pip install videofeatures"

* __video2tfrecord in Python__ <br/>
Released a python package that allows to easily convert RGB video data (e.g. .avi) to the TensorFlow tfrecords file format with the provided 3 color channels for training e.g. a NN in TensorFlow. [[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/video2tfrecords) or "pip install video2tfrecord"


## Other
+ __Probabilistic Planning Course Summaries__ <br/>
Published an overview of the topics discussed & analyzed in the lecture "Probabilistic Planning" at KIT along with the cue cards I used to prepare for the exam. [[overview]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1obuBH4ZWYDTdpxf-gKrmK8MvQvDxPivx)[[cue cards]]() (in German, import XML e.g. into BrainYoo2) 

+ __Speaker at the Deep Learning Student Talk__ <br/>
Invited speaker at the "[Deep Learning Student Talk](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/posterdl.pdf)" at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, presentation and discussion about my Bachelor thesis on CNNs

+ __Machine Learning Course Summaries__ <br/>
Collection of my summaries from the lecture "Machine Learning 1" at KIT [[summaries]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-yrr3JhUpcLMW1FS3NqOGc3N2c?usp=sharing) (in German)
