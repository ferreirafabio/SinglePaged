## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.gif">

I'm a computer science / machine learning M. Sc. student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) with interest in machine learning for robotics. From October 2016 until November 2017 I was engaged with a research project at the H2T ([High Performance Humanoid Technologies](http://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php)) lab, investigating the value of latent representations created by deep video prediction models and working towards the long-term goal of bringing forth intelligence in robotics. I gained my Computer Science B. Sc. with distinction from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences in September 2016 and I am scholar of the German National Academic Foundation.


## Projects
+ __10/2016 - 11/2017__ <br/> 
title: "Deep Episodic Memory: Encoding, Recalling, and Predicting Episodic Experiences for Robot Action Execution" <br/>
1-year research project at the H2T, investigating the value of latent representations generated by video prediction models, paper is under review at ICRA 2018 [[website]](http://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/projects/episodicmemory)[paper]

+ __11/2016__ <br/>
Invited speaker for the "[Deep Learning Student Talk](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/posterdl.pdf)" at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, presentation and discussion about my Bachelor thesis on CNNs

+ __03/2016-07/2016__ <br/>
Bachelor thesis "Optimal Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Defect Classification in Images", at the Robert Bosch Corporate Research department

## Other
* __video2tfrecords in Python__ <br/>
The implementation allows to easily convert RGB video data (e.g. .avi) to the TensorFlow tfrecords file format with the provided 3 color channels for training e.g. a NN in TensorFlow. Due to common hardware/GPU RAM limitations in Deep Learning, this implementation allows to limit the number of frames per video that are actually stored in the tfrecords. [Code](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/video2tfrecords)

* __minimum edit distance in Python__ <br/>
Python implementation that computes the minimum edit distance for two strings (according to the Wagner-Fischer algorithm). [Code](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/minimum-edit-distance-py)

* __Vigenère decipher implementation in Python__ <br/>
Python algorithm for deciphering a Vigenère-encoded message. Implemented in the context of a cryptography class course work. [Code](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/vigenere-py) 

* __Machine Learning Course Summaries__ <br/>
Started collecting and scanning summaries about the lecture "Machine Learning 1" at KIT (in German, Syntax: [Chapter Topic])
