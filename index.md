## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.gif">
In late October 2018, I joined the Stanford AI lab for my master's thesis to work in Jeannette Bohg's [IPRL group](http://iprl.stanford.edu) on graph neural networks. I'm a computer science / machine learning M. Sc. student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) with interest in machine learning for robotics. Accompanying my M. Sc., I worked as a research assistant at the H2T lab ([High Performance Humanoid Technologies](http://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php)) with focus on robot perception and machine intelligence. I gained my Computer Science B. Sc. with distinction from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences in September 2016 and am a scholar of the German National Academic Foundation.
