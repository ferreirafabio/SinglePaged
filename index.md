## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.gif">
In October 2018 I joined Jeannette Bohg's [IPRL group](http://iprl.stanford.edu) at Stanford AI lab for my master's thesis on graph neural networks. I'm a computer science / machine learning M. Sc. student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) with interest in machine learning for robotics. Before I worked at the H2T lab ([High Performance Humanoid Technologies](http://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php)) as a research assistant. I gained my Computer Science B. Sc. with distinction from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences in September 2016 and am a scholar of the German National Academic Foundation.

## Recent Research

+ __Master's thesis at Stanford University and KIT (10/2018-now)__

+ __Conditional Density Estimation (12/2017-now)__ <br/>
This research project's goal is to assess the potential of neural network-based models for density estimation in comparison to kernel-based models (with applications in finance, i.e. risk/asset management)

+ __Paper implementation (Dragan et al., 2015) "Movement Primitives via Optimization" (01/2018)__ <br/>
During a research project, a fellow student and I implemented the mathematical concepts of the paper "Movement Primitives via Optimization" (Dragan et al., 2015) and made the code available. [[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/movement_primitives_via_optimization)


## Coding

+ **[videofeatures](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/videofeatures)**, Python package (pip install videofeatures) for video/image feature extraction (ResNet, VGG, SIFT, SURF) that, based on the selected feature type, trains a fisher vector GMM and computes (improved) fisher vectors

+ **[video2tfrecord](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/video2tfrecord)**, Python package (pip install video2tfrecord) that allows easy conversion of RGB video data to the TensorFlow tfrecords format


## Other
+ __Visiting Lecturer for a Machine Learning introductory course at Baden-Wuerrtemberg Cooperative State University__<br/>
from May 2018 until August 2018 along with a fellow student I will be lecturing a machine learning introductory class for business information systems degree students at Baden-Wuerrtemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW Karlsruhe). [[lecture material]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/Intro_to_ML_DHBW)


+ __Speaker at the Deep Learning Student Talk__ <br/>
Invited speaker at the "[Deep Learning Student Talk](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/posterdl.pdf)" at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, presentation and discussion about my Bachelor thesis on CNNs

+ __Machine Learning Course Summaries__ <br/>
Collection of my summaries from the lecture "Machine Learning 1" at KIT [[summaries]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-yrr3JhUpcLMW1FS3NqOGc3N2c?usp=sharing) (in German)
