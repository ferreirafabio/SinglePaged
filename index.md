## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="pic.gif">

I'm a computer science / machine learning M. Sc. student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu) with interest in machine learning for robotics. From October 2016 until November 2017 I was engaged with a research project at the H2T ([High Performance Humanoid Technologies](http://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/index.php)) lab, investigating the value of latent representations created by deep video prediction models and working towards the long-term goal of bringing forth intelligence in robotics. I gained my Computer Science B. Sc. with distinction from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences in September 2016 and I am scholar of the German National Academic Foundation.


## Projects
+ __since 12/2017__ <br/>
Research project in the financial sector in which the feasibility of NNs for estimating (conditional) probability densities in a non-parametric way is investigated. 

+ __11/2016-11/2017__ <br/>
title: "Deep Episodic Memory: Encoding, Recalling, and Predicting Episodic Experiences for Robot Action Execution" <br/>
1-year research project at the H2T, investigating the value of latent representations generated by video prediction models, under review at Robotics and Automation Letters [[website]](http://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/projects/episodicmemory)[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04134)

+ __11/2016__ <br/>
Invited speaker for the "[Deep Learning Student Talk](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/posterdl.pdf)" at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, presentation and discussion about my Bachelor thesis on CNNs

+ __03/2016-07/2016__ <br/>
Bachelor thesis "Optimal Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Defect Classification in Images", at the Robert Bosch Corporate Research department

## Other
+ __video feature extraction and fisher vectors__ <br/>
Jonas Rothfuss and I released a package for video/image feature extraction (ResNet, VGG, SIFT, SURF) that based on the selected feature type, trains a fisher vector GMM and computes the (improved) fisher vectors. One imaginable application is to set-up a feature extractor baseline and benchmark one's approach in a research paper. [[code]](https://github.com/jonasrothfuss/videofeatures) or "pip install videofeatures"

+ __Paper implementation "Movement Primitives via Optimization" (Dragan et al., 2015)__ <br/>
During a research project, a fellow student and I implemented the mathematical concepts of the paper "Movement Primitives via Optimization" (Dragan et al., 2015) and made the code available.[[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/movement_primitives_via_optimization)

* __video2tfrecords in Python__ <br/>
The implementation allows to easily convert RGB video data (e.g. .avi) to the TensorFlow tfrecords file format with the provided 3 color channels for training e.g. a NN in TensorFlow. Due to common hardware/GPU RAM limitations in Deep Learning, this implementation allows to limit the number of frames per video that are actually stored in the tfrecords. [[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/video2tfrecords) or "pip install video2tfrecord"

* __minimum edit distance in Python__ <br/>
Python implementation that computes the minimum edit distance for two strings (according to the Wagner-Fischer algorithm). [[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/minimum-edit-distance-py)

* __Vigenère decipher implementation in Python__ <br/>
Python algorithm for deciphering a Vigenère-encoded message. Implemented in the context of a cryptography class course work. [[code]](https://github.com/ferreirafabio/vigenere-py) 

* __Machine Learning Course Summaries__ <br/>
Started collecting and scanning summaries about the lecture "Machine Learning 1" at KIT (in German, Syntax: [Chapter Topic])
  * [05 Reinforcement Learning](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/ML1/ReinforcementLearning.pdf)
  * [06 Support Vector Machine](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/ML1/SVM.pdf)
  * [07 Bayesian Learning](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/ML1/LernenNachBayes.pdf)
  * [08 Hidden Markov Models](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/ML1/HiddenMarkovModels.pdf)
  * [09 Markov Logic Networks](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/ML1/MarkovLogicNetze.pdf)
  * [10 Deductive Learning](https://ferreirafabio.github.io/data/ML1/DeduktivesLernen.pdf)
